# Final Project HGEN48600  Genetic Drift in a Finite Population as an Example of Stochastic Modeling
## Jose Antonio Urban Aragon, Ethan Zhong
### General Description of the Project



We elaborated some vignettes to explain random genetic drift and how this process can be modelled as **binomial sampling**, **discrete Markov chain**, and a difussion process. We integrated the information in 4 different vignettes. You can visit the vignettes online by clicking on each one of the options:  

* [Introduction and Binomial Sampling](https://jaurbanchicago.github.io/docs/Genetic_Drift_Intro.html)
* [Genetic Drift as a Markov Chain](https://jaurbanchicago.github.io/docs/Genetic_Drift_Markov.html)
* [Introduction to Diffusion Process](https://jaurbanchicago.github.io/docs/diffusion_process.html)
* [Genetic Drift as a Diffusion Process](https://jaurbanchicago.github.io/docs/diffusion_approx.html)


The .Rmd and .html files will be uploaded by each one of us in Canvas. Besides, you will be able to find them in the following [Github repository](https://github.com/jaurbanChicago/jaurbanChicago.github.io).
