# Brief Introduction to Discrete Markov Chains

Before getting into the specific details of the relationship between Markov chains and genetic drift, it is necessary to briefly explain what a discrete, finite Markov chain is.    
  
LetÂ´s consider a discrete random variable $X$, which at time points $0,1,2,3,...$, takes values $0,1,2,...,M$. Therefore, it is precise to say that each state $E_i$, $X$ takes the value $i$ [2]. This means that at each state $E_i$ at some time $t$, $X$ is in some state $E_i$. A variable is said to be **Markovian** if the probability of a certain outcome in the next time step $t+1$ depends only on the present state at time $t$ and is memoryless with regard to any previous time step $t-1,t-2,...$. Therefore, we can now define **a discrete Markov chain** as a sequence of discrete random variables in which the probability distribution of the different states at each time $t$ depends only on the state at time $t-1$ [1,2].


Some important mathematical notation to describe a discrete Markov chain is [2,3]:  
$$
P(E_{n+1}|E_{n})=i,E_{n-1}=i_{n-1},...,E_1=i_1,E_0=i_0)=P(E_{n+1}=j|E_n=i)\\
\mathbb{A \space discrete \space Markov \space is \space homogeneous \space if:}\\
P(E_{n+1}|E_{n})=P(E_i=j|E_{i-1}=i) \space \mathbb{for \space all} \space n, \mathbb{so} \space P(E_i=j|E_{i-1})=P_{ij}\\
P_{ij} \gt 0;i,j \ge 0; \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}P_{ij}=1 \\
\mathbb{A \space transition \space probability \space matrix \space can \space be \space assembled \space to \space represent \space the \space probabilities \space of \space} P_{ij} \space \\
P_{ij}= \begin{pmatrix}
p_{00} & p_{01} & ... & p_{0M}\\
p_{00} & p_{11} & ... & p_{1M} \\
.\\
.\\
.\\
p_{M0} & p_{M1} & ... & p_{MM}
\end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbb{This \space is \space an \space stochastic \space matrix, so \space all \space rows \space must \space sum \space to \space 1}
$$


Next, we are going to describe some important characteristics and features of a Markov chain that will be relevant for understanding its relationship with genetic drift
