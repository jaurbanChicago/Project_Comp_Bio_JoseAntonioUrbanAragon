# Genetic Drift in Finite Populations

Much population genetic theory concentrates on describing the changes of allele frequencies through time. The two most important factors influencing allele trajectories through time are natural selection and **genetic drift** [1]. In these vignettes, we will focus on genetic drift and how this process may be modeled as a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) in a [Wright-Fisher population](https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/wright_fisher_model.html).
  
Genetic drift is the random change of allele frequencies through time in populations of finite size [1,2]. Different random processes could affect the outcome of genetic drift, and they might have nothing to do with the individuals' fitness [1]. For example, some individuals may die before they reach reproductive age because of extrinsic effects not related to their genetic makeup [1]. Additionally, there is inherent randomness in Mendelian segregation, and these effects could become more apparent when populations are small (we will shortly see why this is the case) [1,2].  



# Models Used to Model Genetic Drift

In this section of the vignette, we will introduce three basic models that can be used to analyze properties of genetic drift:
  
  * Binomial distribution  
  * Markov chain  
  * Diffusion process (continuous time approximation to the Markov chain)
