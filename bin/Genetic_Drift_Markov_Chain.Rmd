# Genetic Drift in Finite Populations

Much population genetic theory concentrates on describing the changes of allele frequencies through time. The two most important factors influencing allele trajectories through time are natural selection and **genetic drift** [1]. In these vignettes, we will focus on explaining " Genetic drift is the random change of allele frequencies due to sampling errors in populations of finite size [1,2]. Genetic drift may be explained by different random processes that could affect the organisms' chance of reproduction and have nothing to do with fitness. For example, some individuals may die before they reach reproductive age because of extrinsic effect not related to their genetic make-up [1].
